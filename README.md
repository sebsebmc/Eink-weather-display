# E-Ink Weather Display

This is my little weather display project using an (Arduino Feather C6)[https://www.adafruit.com/product/5933] and a (Waveshare 4 inch 6 color Eink Display)[https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/4inch_e-Paper_HAT%2B_(E)_Manual]

The weather data comes from (PirateWeather)[https://pirateweather.net/en/latest/] which is displayed as the current weather status, the high/low temp and icon for the 3-day forecast, and a percipitation chance chart showing the next 24 hours.
